      <p>On this page you find a number of pictures of famous twentieth century physicists. All of them were in one way or another linked to the making of the atomic bomb.

      <p>At the beginning of the twentieth century physics was undergoing radical changes. Study of atoms revealed phenomena that could not be explained by existing classical theories. Marie Curie studied radio activity
        and from Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity followed the equivalence of mass and energy. Physicists soon realised that the atomic nucleus contained enormous amounts of energy and just with like exothermic
        chemical reactions this energy could in theory be used to create atomic bombs. This remained a theoretical possibility for a long time until in the 1930s the neutron was discovered and used to probe the atom and
        fission was discovered. With world war 2 raging and propelled by the fear that the Germans were working on an atomic bomb the British and Americans launched their own efforts to develop the bomb which finally lead to the bombing
        of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. You can see some pictures of famous phycisists below or look at them in <a href="physicist-gallery.html" target="_blank">this photo gallery</a> on a separate page.

        In 1905 Einstein experienced his annus mirabilis. Einstein published four groundbreaking papers. These outlined a theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, 
        introduced his special theory of relativity—a theory which addressed the inability of classical mechanics to account satisfactorily for the behavior of the electromagnetic field—and demonstrated that 
        if the special theory is correct, mass and energy are equivalent to each other.

        Richard Phillips Feynman (May 11, 1918 - February 15, 1988) was an American theoretical physicist, known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics, 
        the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, as well as his work in particle physics for which he proposed the parton model. For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, 
        Feynman received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 jointly with Julian Schwinger and Shin'ichirō Tomonaga.

            <h1>Atomic Physics</h1>
            <p>
                At the beginning of the twentieth century physics was undergoing radical changes. Study of atoms revealed phenomena that could not be explained by existing classical theories. Marie Curie studied radio activity
      and from Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity followed the equivalence of mass and energy. Physicists soon realised that the atomic nucleus contained enormous amounts of energy and just with like exothermic
    chemical reactions this energy could in theory be used to create atomic bombs. This remained a theoretical possibility for a long time until in the 1930s the neutron was discovered and used to probe the atom and
  fission was discovered. With world war 2 raging and propelled by the fear that the Germans were working on an atomic bomb the British and Americans launched their own efforts to develop the bomb which finally lead to the bombing
of Nagasaki and Hiroshima.

            <p>The final objective of this project is to create a study aid containing the theory section for multiple subjects and a quiz section to practice and memorize the material. 
                The theory and quiz sections will have their own html page, this home page serves as a starting point to select a topic to read about or to practice with a quiz. 
                At the moment the site only contains example
                content to illustrate the lqyout, responsiveness and the concepts involved. For the quiz part there are only a few questions and answers available and always the same set of questions is posed.
                All scripting is currently still done on the client side. The ambition is that in the real version there will be many questions and that a selection will be served 'randomly' on the server side. 
                The application will then keep track of the number of correct answers per question and repeat questions that were answered wrong before. There will be multiple choice questions and open questions. 
                The user should be able to pick from subsets of the theory and to chose the number of questions. Also, 2 modes of quizzing are foreseen : with and without time limit. 
                But today all of this does not exist yet.

                There are 3 links at the left or top of the screen depending on your viewport width. About navigates you to this page. The theory link will navigate to a page with theory to study.

            <h2>Quiz</h2>
            <p>
                The third link called Quiz will navigate you to the quiz section. In the quiz you will get a randomly selected multiple choice question. After selecting your answer and submitting the check answer 
                button you will get a message box telling you if your answer was correct. Upon closing the message a new question will be shown.
